# Human_Resources_Data_Visualization
The HR data can sometimes be hard to come by and HR professionals lag behind with respect to the data analysis and data visualizations. Thus, this data has been created from scratch revolving around a fictitious company called Dental Magic to incorporate various competency related analysis and to understand performance related queries with salary distributions. The data set has been obtained from the Kaggle website for the purpose of this assignment https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set. Some initial analysis has been conducted using Excel for understanding how different columns in the data set can answer business related problems.

The core data set of the Dental Magic company contains name, DOBâ€™s, age, gender, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, position title, pay rate, manager names and performance scores as their variable list. Some of important questions that aims to solve the business problems of the company include:
1.	Is there a relationship between a current working employee and their performance score?
2.	What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
3.	What are the best recruiting sources for hiring to ensure a diverse population?
4.	Does the marital status of an employee affect their performance in the company?
5.	How does the age of an employee and pay scale impact their performance?

Since the visualizations will be performed using the Tableau software, the most common types of graphs that can be used to explain the data are bar plots, line trends, heat maps to understand the density of a particular variable and geographical maps to show state-wise or zip code-wise employees recruited. Scatter plots can be used to understand the correlation between the payrate and performance score of the employees.

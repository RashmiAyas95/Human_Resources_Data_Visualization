# Human_Resources_Data_Visualization
The HR data can sometimes be hard to come by and HR professionals lag behind with respect to the data analysis and data visualizations. Thus, this data has been created from scratch revolving around a fictitious company called Dental Magic to incorporate various competency related analysis and to understand performance related queries with salary distributions. The data set has been obtained from the Kaggle website for the purpose of this assignment. Some initial analysis has been conducted using Excel for understanding how different columns in the data set can answer business related problems.
